# St. Olaf Go Fish
A relatively simple computer based game of Go Fish, the classic card game.

## A basic AI
This project's main feature is its AI players, which are able to play at the level of the average toddler.

## Intuitive and easy to start
Assuming you are able to get PyGame installed and running for Python 3.2, there should not be any issues in running this code and enjoying yourself some good old fashioned Go Fish. Feel free to modify the code and mess around with the AI settings of course!

### Enjoy!
